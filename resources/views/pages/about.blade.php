    <h1>About Minutemen</h1>
    <p>Minutemen is an online platform for laser tag enthusiasts whereon they can connect and compete with one another.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to make sure you can always find someone to play with and always be ready for battle.</p>
    <h2>Why "Minutemen"?</h2>
    <p>
        Historically, minutemen were a kind of militia that would be ready to defend their homes "at a minute's notice".
        They were civilian colonists who independently organized to form well-prepared militia companies self-trained
        in weaponry, tactics, and military strategies from the American colonial partisan militia during
        the American Revolutionary War.
    </p>
    <p>We found this to be a fitting comparison with our own eagerness to do battle whenever, with whomever.</p>
